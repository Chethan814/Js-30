Let's break it down:
Loop Control: The loop control should iterate over the length of the array, but currently, you're iterating over the array object itself.

Reducer Function Application: You need to apply the reducer function to each element while updating the init value.

Here's where to make changes:

Correct Implementation (Structure):
javascript
var reduce = function(nums, fn, init) {
    // Initialize the result with the initial value
    let result = init;

    // Iterate over the array
    for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // Update result with the function applied to the current element and the accumulator
        result = fn(result, nums[i]);
    }

    // Return the final result
    return result;
};
Explanation:
Initialization: Start with result = init.

Loop: Iterate over each element of the array using a for loop.

Apply Reducer Function: Update result by applying fn to the current value of result and the current element nums[i].

Return Result: After iterating through all elements, return result.

This will give you the correct behavior as specified in your question.

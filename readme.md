## Introduction

In this repository, I'm embarking on a journey to improve my JavaScript skills by solving LeetCode problems. As a beginner, my focus is on building a strong foundation in logical thinking and problem-solving.

## Why This Project

- **Learning by Doing**: Hands-on practice is the best way to understand and retain new concepts.
- **Building Confidence**: Tackling problems one step at a time helps build confidence in my coding abilities.
- **Documenting Progress**: Keeping track of my progress motivates me and helps me see how far I've come.

## First Steps

To get started, I’m focusing on understanding basic concepts and solving simpler problems that reinforce these foundations. Here’s a brief outline of my initial plan:

### Week 1: Basic Concepts
- **Days 1**: Write a function createHelloWorld. It should return a new function that always returns "Hello World".
- **Days 2**: Given an integer n, return a counter function. This counter function initially returns n and then returns 1 more than the previous value every subsequent time it is called (n, n + 1, n + 2, etc).
- **Days 3**: Write a function expect that helps developers test their code. It should take in any value val and return an object with the following two functions.




## Problem List

### Basic Questions
- 2667. Create Hello World Function
- 2620. Counter
- 2704. To Be Or Not To Be

### More to come...
